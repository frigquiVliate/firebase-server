## What is Accent EXCEL Password Recovery?
     
Accent EXCEL Password Recovery is a software program developed by Passcovery, a company that specializes in password recovery solutions for various file formats and applications. Accent EXCEL Password Recovery is designed to recover or remove passwords from Microsoft Excel files, regardless of their complexity or length.

Accent EXCEL Password Recovery supports all types of passwords that can be set in Microsoft Excel, such as:
     
- Password to open: This is the password that prevents you from opening the file without entering it.
- Password to modify: This is the password that allows you to open the file in read-only mode, but not to edit or save it.
- Worksheet and workbook passwords: These are the passwords that protect specific sheets or the entire workbook from being modified, deleted, or moved.
- VBA project password: This is the password that protects the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code from being viewed or edited.

Accent EXCEL Password Recovery can recover or remove any of these passwords in a matter of minutes, depending on the password complexity and the speed of your computer. It uses advanced algorithms and optimization techniques to ensure the fastest and most efficient password recovery possible.
     
## How does Accent EXCEL Password Recovery work?
     
Accent EXCEL Password Recovery works by using different methods of password attack, depending on the type of password and the version of Microsoft Excel. The program automatically detects the file format and chooses the best method for each case. The main methods are:

- Instant recovery/removal: This method applies to permissions passwords, such as worksheet, workbook, and VBA project passwords. Accent EXCEL Password Recovery can instantly remove these passwords without affecting the file content or structure.
- Brute force attack: This method applies to passwords to open and passwords to modify. Accent EXCEL Password Recovery tries all possible combinations of characters until it finds the correct password. This method can be customized by using a mask, a dictionary, or a scenario.

A mask is a way of reducing the search space by specifying some characteristics of the password, such as its length, position, or character set. For example, if you know that your password is 8 characters long and starts with "a", you can set a mask like "a???????" and save time by skipping all other combinations.
     
A dictionary is a file that contains a list of words or phrases that are likely to be used as passwords. Accent EXCEL Password Recovery can use up to four dictionaries simultaneously, combine them together, and mutate them according to some rules. For example, if you have a dictionary with common names, you can mutate it by adding numbers or symbols at the end, such as "John123" or "Mary!"
     
A scenario is a predefined sequence of attacks with different settings. Accent EXCEL Password Recovery comes with several scenarios that cover common cases of password usage. For example, there is a scenario that tries common passwords first, then dictionary words, then masks with different character sets. You can also create your own scenarios by editing text files.
